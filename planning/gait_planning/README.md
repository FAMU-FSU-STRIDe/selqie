# Gait Planning Notes

- Using SBMPO to generate gait plans
- 4 different gait types:
    - Walking
    - Jumping
    - Swimming
    - Sinking
- Jumping and sinking gaits are used to transition between walking and swimming
- Gait controls will be determined by experimental data
- Set up grid resolution to plan over ~50x50 maps at ~1Hz
